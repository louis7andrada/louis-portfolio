comment: "Louis's second studio was in a shared artist space that rents small units, but he stayed there for only about a month. He then moved to a larger apartment, where he set up his third studio in the living room. In this picture, the completed painting 'Self-portrait, 2026' is displayed on the easel in his third studio."
