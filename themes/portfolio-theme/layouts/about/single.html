        Louis Andrada is a 24-year-old Brazilian painter currently based in Toronto. Born and raised in Brazil, he moved to Canada at 19, bringing with him a cultural foundation shaped by Brazilian folklore and its symbolic narratives. He is formally trained in film photography and photo production, with a background grounded in analog processes and darkroom technique. This technical formation informs his approach to image construction, material control, and visual structure within his painting practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrada’s work bridges his photographic training with painting, developing a distinct visual language rooted in mechanical reproduction, fragmentation, and tonal precision.

        Louis Andrada’s practice merges the macabre with the technical discipline of film photography printing. Drawing from analog darkroom processes, he translates grain, chemical contrast, half-tone structures, and disrupted resolution into paint. His images often appear as if developed rather than composed, emerging through layers that mimic photographic exposure and mechanical breakdown.

      <p>
        Influenced by Brazilian folklore and occult symbolism, his work confronts fear directly. Forms surface and dissolve within the same frame, suspended between clarity and decay. The fragmentation is deliberate, evoking images that feel unstable, as though they are resisting full visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        He paints only what unsettles him. Each image is constructed as an act of confrontation, rendering scenes that, if encountered in reality, would provoke avoidance. Through paint, he fixes the uncanny in place. The work functions as containment: an attempt to materialize fear on canvas so that it remains there and nowhere else.
