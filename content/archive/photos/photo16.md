comment: "Louis’s second studio was in a shared artist space that rents small units, but he stayed there for only about a month. He then moved to a larger apartment, where he set up his third studio in the living room. In this picture, Louis is seated in front of his completed painting, Untitled (Death), which stands against the wall behind him."
