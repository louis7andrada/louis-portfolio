comment: "Louis second studio was at an artist studio company that rents small spaces, however louis only stayed there for about a month. after that Louis moved to a new apartment much bigger, where he was able to set his 3rd studio in his living room. In this picture you can see Louis working a new painting in the easel at the 3rd studio."
