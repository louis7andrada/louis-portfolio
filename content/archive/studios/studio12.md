comment: "Louis second studio was at an artist studio company that rents small spaces, however louis only stayed there for about a month. after that Louis moved to a new apartment much bigger, where he was able to set his 3rd studio in his living room. In this picture you can see more of Louis new appartment and 'Subjects Nº3 & 4' finalized painting standing by the wall."
