comment: "Louis's second studio was in a shared artist space that rents small units, but he stayed there for only about a month. He then moved to a larger apartment, where he set up his third studio in the living room. In this picture, more of Louis's new apartment is visible, with the completed painting 'Subjects N.3 & 4' standing against the wall."
