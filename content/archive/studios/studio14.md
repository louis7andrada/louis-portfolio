comment: "Louis's second studio was in a shared artist space that rents small units, but he stayed there for only about a month. He then moved to a larger apartment, where he set up his third studio in the living room. In this picture, more of the third studio is visible, with the completed painting 'Untitled (Death)' standing against the wall."
