comment: "Louis second studio was at an artist studio company that rents small spaces, however louis only stayed there for about a month. after that Louis moved to a new apartment much bigger, where he was able to set his 3rd studio in his living room. In this picture you can see Louis sitting in front of 'Untitled (Death)' finalized painting standing behind by the wall."
